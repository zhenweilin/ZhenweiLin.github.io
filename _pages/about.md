I'm a final year of phd student from SUFE. My research interest includes optimization theory, especially first-order method.



## Profile

I possess strong theoretical and practical skills. Throughout my doctoral studies, my research has been centered on the complexity analysis of first-order methods for various problems, including function-constrained optimization, minimax games, second-order cone programming (SOCP) and semidefinite programming (SDP). The core of my work involves strategies to accelerate convergence rates, supported by numerical experiments to validate theoretical findings. Additionally, a significant engineering achievement in my research is the application of first-order methods to solve SOCP and SDP.
